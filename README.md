## Summary
The system that is being modelled is a grocery shopping app. This grocery store has three specialized category, eggs, milk, and ice cream. The user can start their shopping by selecting the specialty shopping category, eggs, milk, and ice cream. Once they select the category, the user can then select the specific item and key in the quantity on such item. The user can also view the shopping list with up-to-date selections. They can go back to select additional purchase item and view their shopping cart again. The shopping cart shows the selected items, the unit price, quantity, subtotal price, tax and total price. The user can then checkout, enter username and password to complete the payment. The shopping list has selections between eggs, milk, and ice cream, this is a has-a relationship or an aggregation relationship as the shopping list *has* eggs, milk, and ice cream. The eggs, milk, and ice cream are products, this is an is-a relationship or an inheritence relationship.
