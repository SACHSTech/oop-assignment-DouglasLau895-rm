## Summary
The system that is being modelled is a grocery shopping app. This grocery store has limited items and only sells premium eggs, milk, and ice cream. The user can select items and browse their shopping cart before checking out. The shopping list has selections between eggs, milk, and ice cream, this is a has-a relationship or an aggregation relationship as the shopping list *has* eggs, milk, and ice cream. The eggs, milk, and ice cream are products, this is an is-a relatioinship or an inheritence realtionship. Once the user completes their product selection they will have an option for pick-up or delivery, but delivery will include a delivery fee. The user will then head to checkout, the subtotal, tax, and total are calculated and user inputs payment method. Either an estimated time of arrival is given if the user selected the delivery option or a pick-up time is given.
